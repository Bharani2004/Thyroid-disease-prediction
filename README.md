Thyroid disease diagnosis is vital for effective management and improved patient outcomes, with ultrasound imaging serving as a key non-invasive tool for detecting abnormalities like nodules, cysts, and malignancies. 

Traditional diagnostic methods often face challenges in achieving precision and efficiency, highlighting the need for an advanced system leveraging cutting-edge technology. 

The proposed AI-based decision support system that integrates diverse ultrasound image data, employing a hybrid deep-learning approach—ResUNet and ResUNet++ for segmentation, and ResNet-50 for classification—to automate thyroid nodule analysis. 

This system captures complex patterns in nodule characteristics, delivering rapid, accurate classifications tailored to specific thyroid conditions and enhances diagnostic precision, contributing to more effective thyroid disease management.
